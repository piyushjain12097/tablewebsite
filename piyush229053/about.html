"La Fontaine took its name from the great 17th Century French poet and fabulist,
<br>
 Jean de la Fontaine, whose books I read in nursery school. Just like La Fontaine's 
 <br>
 colorful imagery, our food is filled with colorful spices from France and Italy. 
<br>
 This style of cuisine is called Proven√ßale, the best of both worlds in Southern Europe." - Hasan Yildiz
